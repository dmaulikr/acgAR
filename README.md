# ACG in Augmented Reality
[Course project] [Deprecated] The campus of the American College of Greece in Augmented Reality

While looking through the camera of an iPad and an iPhone, this application gives you the ability to explore the campus of the American College of Greece by using different augmented reality software approaches. Based on your location and your field of view, the application provides you with information on what's around you and gives you directions to ACGâ€™s buildings and facilities.
